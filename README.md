# Pairs-Trading-Using-Python
**Pairs Trading Strategy Project ðŸ“ˆðŸ’¼**

**Description:** This project implements a pairs trading strategy using Python, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques. Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that involves trading a portfolio of two closely related financial instruments to profit from their relative movements. The project includes data preparation steps such as collecting data from Yahoo Finance, interpolating missing values, and smoothing outliers. It also performs correlation and co-integration analysis to identify potential trading opportunities. Trading signals are generated based on Z-score analysis of asset ratios, and the performance of the strategy is evaluated using cumulative profit charts.
